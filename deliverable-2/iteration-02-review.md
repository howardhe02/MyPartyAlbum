## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

**1. Having a clear agenda during group meetings:**

Before our scheduled group meetings, we made a list of the things that we needed to talk about during the meeting on our communication platform, Discord. Doing this helped each group member enter the meeting knowing what to expect, making us better prepared as to what to the goal of the day's meeting will be, and allowing us to achieve that goal in a timely manner. Having a clear agenda has been extremely vital to strong communication within the team, which we believe is of great importance if we wish to succeed in this course. Moreover, throughout the term, we made sure to take extensive minutes for our group meetings. This allowed us to go over decisions we made or tasks that were assigned during the meeting at a later date, thereby keeping us more organised. Minutes for group meetings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5j1pMHU8YmygSgWoiKFKgz6d2AOQIhuWnq_eDV3MTo/edit).

**2. Tasks were divided in a way where we didn't need to rely on the completion of someone else's task.**

We divided our tasks for individual group members in a way where we didn't need to wait for one group member to finish a task before another group member could start working on theirs. We assigned dependent tasks to the same subteam so that if one subteam falls behind in completing their assigned user story, it would not stop the other subteams in completing their assigned tasks. Dividing the tasks in this manner also meant that we had less work to do when merging the various branches created throughout the development process, thereby improving team efficiency.

3. Frequent meetings with partners (My Party Album) 

We set up weekly meetings with the CEO of My Party Album in order to discuss our current progress and ensure that we are on the right track. This proved to be vital because it allowed us to prioritise tasks according to the partner's requirements. In addition, these meetings allowed us to ask questions directly, which helped clear up misunderstandings and created a more streamlined development process. Moreover, we made sure to take detailed minutes for our partner meetings, which ensured that group members unable to attend these meetings were kept well informed regarding what was discussed, thereby increasing cohesiveness within the group and providing a clearer understanding of what we should be working on, and how we should be working on it. Minutes for meetings with the partner can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Up0bZXUxvJ_kfKtX-sFQ95ZA6MmkoQ5MMO9aSw9j-aw/edit#heading=h.d1ejxfylyo6m)

4. Fair and equal division of workload for D1

Lastly, we divided the workload for deliverable 1 in a manner where members were able to choose the parts that they wanted to work on, while also ensuring that the division of the workload was equal. This resulted in an efficient and collaborative environment, since members were able to pick tasks that they wanted to do, and once everyone had completed their assigned tasks, the group then went over each other's work to point out any possible areas of improvement. With 6 different people reviewing each question, we were able to produce a polished version of our first effort as a team, and therefore the division of the workload for D1 helped us complete the deliverable in a timely and efficient manner.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Setting vague expectations and deadlines for tasks 

One mistake we made was setting vague expectations and deadlines for the tasks we had to complete. While our target user stories were divided up amongst the subteams that we formed, we were unable to set hard deadlines for progress on the user stories. This resulted in some wasted time, as the only hard deadline for our work was 4th November (i.e., the deadline for D2). While we did realise our mistake and attempt to rectify it, if we had done so sooner, it would have saved us alot of trouble in the week of the D2 deadline, especially since one of our group members had to drop the course. In hindsight, we should have set better deadlines and clearer expectations as to what tasks should be completed by setting an acceptance criteria that must be met by said deadlines.

2. Not having meetings discussing code design/architecture

Another mistake we made was that a few members created the code design/architecture, but all group members were not involved in the process. We held a meeting after the architecture had been designed to discuss it, but involvement in the planning would have created a better understanding of how the code worked. This resulted in some wasted time during the development process as members took their time in understanding the architecture and how it ties in to their assigned tasks, which caused the development process to be slower than it should have been.

3. Not utilzing Jira Boards | [A link to our Jira Board](https://junsong.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MPA/boards/1)

While our group had set up a Jira board, we did not use it as much as we should have to organise ourselves. While we documented things we needed to do, and issues we needed to address on Discord, Jira would have kept us more organised. Using Jira more extensively would have helped us avoid the mistake outline in point 1 - setting vague expectations and deadlines for tasks - to the best of our group's abilities.

#### Q3. Planned changes

1. Improve github workflow (create "dev" branch)

One of the productivity issues we had was spending a lot of time waiting for features to be fully developed before we sync up. While developing a feature, we would often hold on to merging until the feature is ready for production. However, this is not ideal because we want to develop multiple features in parallel, with as little merge conflicts as possible. To solve this, we will be creating a dev branch. A dev branch will let us make commits for features that not production-ready yet, but still keep each other in sync.

2. Use jira boards to set clearer expectations

As mentioned above, we think we need to make expectations for tasks clearer. This includes deadlines, progress, and requirements. Looking back at deliverable 2, we had to set up mutliple meetings to assign tasks and set deadlines. One thing we can do using Jira is splitting a big task into multiple smaller tasks. This is really valuable for us because we found it hard to track progress of a big feature. With Jira, we will be able to see how we are doing in a glance and readjust accordingly.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

We prepared our demos by listing out the user stories we've completed for D2. With that, we brainstormed questions that will better help us understand the expectations from our partners. We managed to demo the following 3 features. 
1. Applying multiple filters (with new UI)
2. Adding, removing, and moving stickerse
3. Undo button


Our partners were satisfied with the features demo. They liked the addition of the cancel button to the slider tab. They also agreed with our design for the stickers edit layout. Overall, they thought our deliverables were solid and would like to deploy a test release on the Google Play Store.

There are changes that were requested by our partners, and we will be looking into these for D3. 

- For the filters page, they wanted to remove the Hue and Toons sliders. We all agreed that these filters are more suited for presets and not sliders. So when we introduce presets, we will be removing the slider option from Hue and Toons.

- At the moment, stickers are not shown on the filters tab. However, our partners thought it would be better if stickers did show up, since the editor should always reflect what will be saved when the 'save' button is clicked. Also, they suggested that we keep the delete button upright as having it rotate alongside the sticker made it confusing when it turns into a 'plus' sign.

- Our partners also requested us to create folders for different stickers, in a way similar to the emoji selector on our phones, so users can easily find the ones they want to use.

- Since we have set a limit on how many undos a user can perform, they thought it would a good idea to have a clear button that removes any add-ons applied to the image.

From a product perspective, its always important to think about the usefulness and the usability of a feature. Through our demo we gained insight into what a user might think about. We learned that clarity, usefulness, and ease-of-use are important factors to consider as we design and implement user-facing features. Going forward, we will keep this criteria in mind, and ask ourselves whether what we developed achieved the three considerations.
